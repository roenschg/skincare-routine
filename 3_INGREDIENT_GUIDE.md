# Ingredient Guide: What Each Active Does & What to Avoid

---

## PART 1: YOUR ACTIVES - WHAT THEY DO

These are the ingredients in your routine and their scientifically-proven benefits.

---

### 1. NIACINAMIDE (Vitamin B3)

**What it is:**
Water-soluble vitamin that works with natural substances in skin.

**Your concentration:** 4% (CeraVe PM Lotion)

**What it does:**

**✅ Anti-Aging:**
- Increases collagen production (reduces fine lines)
- Improves skin elasticity
- Reduces sallowness (yellowing of skin with age)
- Minimizes pore appearance (by regulating oil)

**✅ Barrier Repair:**
- Increases ceramide synthesis (strengthens skin barrier)
- Reduces transepidermal water loss (keeps skin hydrated)
- Protects against environmental damage

**✅ Anti-Inflammatory:**
- Reduces redness and blotchiness
- Calms acne and rosacea
- Decreases inflammation from other actives

**✅ Oil Control:**
- Regulates sebum production
- Reduces shine without drying
- Prevents clogged pores

**✅ Hyperpigmentation:**
- Inhibits melanosome transfer (reduces dark spots)
- Evens skin tone
- Brightens overall complexion

**How it works:**
Niacinamide is converted to NAD+ in skin cells. NAD+ is essential for:
- Cellular energy production
- DNA repair
- Protein synthesis (including collagen)

**Research evidence:**
- 4% niacinamide shows significant improvement in fine lines after 8-12 weeks
- 2-5% range is optimal (higher doesn't provide additional benefit)
- Works synergistically with Vitamin C (different pathways)

**Side effects (rare at 4%):**
- Mild flushing (temporary redness)
- Itching (usually indicates sensitivity)
- Breakouts (usually purging, subsides in 2-4 weeks)

**Bryan's protocol:** Uses morning AND night (your CeraVe PM is for both despite the name)

---

### 2. VITAMIN C (L-Ascorbic Acid)

**What it is:**
Pure, unaltered form of Vitamin C - the most potent and bioavailable.

**Your concentration:** 23% (The Ordinary Suspension)

**What it does:**

**✅ Antioxidant Protection:**
- Neutralizes free radicals from UV exposure
- Protects against pollution damage
- Prevents oxidative stress
- Reduces DNA damage from sun

**✅ Collagen Synthesis:**
- Essential cofactor for collagen production
- Stimulates fibroblasts (collagen-making cells)
- Maintains existing collagen structure
- Reduces collagen breakdown

**✅ Brightening:**
- Inhibits tyrosinase (enzyme that makes melanin)
- Reduces existing hyperpigmentation
- Prevents new dark spots
- Creates radiant, even skin tone

**✅ Anti-Inflammatory:**
- Calms redness and irritation
- Reduces post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation
- Helps healing

**How it works:**
Vitamin C is a potent antioxidant that:
1. Donates electrons to neutralize free radicals
2. Regenerates other antioxidants (Vitamin E)
3. Required for collagen synthesis enzymes
4. Directly inhibits melanin production

**Research evidence:**
- 15-20% L-Ascorbic Acid shows significant anti-aging after 12 weeks
- 23% is maximum effective concentration (higher causes irritation without added benefit)
- Must be applied to dry skin (water oxidizes it)
- Most effective when fresh (oxidizes over time)

**Why gritty texture is good:**
The Ordinary uses anhydrous (water-free) formula. Water causes Vitamin C to oxidize and lose potency. The gritty texture means:
- Pure L-Ascorbic Acid (not diluted)
- Stable formulation
- Maximum potency
- Trade-off: Less elegant texture for better results

**Side effects:**
- Tingling/stinging (normal first 1-2 weeks)
- Redness (if too strong or sensitive skin)
- Oxidation (turns orange/brown when expired - discard)

**Bryan's protocol:** Uses EVERY MORNING (never evening - it's for daytime protection)

---

### 3. HYALURONIC ACID (HA)

**What it is:**
Naturally occurring molecule that holds water in skin.

**Your concentration:** 2% (The Ordinary) - optimal range

**What it does:**

**✅ Deep Hydration:**
- Holds 1,000x its weight in water
- Draws moisture into skin
- Hydrates multiple skin layers
- Plumps skin from within

**✅ Fine Line Reduction:**
- Fills in fine lines temporarily
- Long-term hydration reduces wrinkle depth
- Creates smoother skin texture

**✅ Barrier Support:**
- Helps skin retain moisture
- Supports lipid barrier function
- Reduces transepidermal water loss

**✅ Soothing:**
- Calms irritated skin
- Reduces redness
- Comforts dry, tight skin

**How it works:**
HA is a glycosaminoglycan (sugar molecule) that:
1. Binds to water molecules in environment
2. Pulls water into stratum corneum (outer skin layer)
3. Different molecular weights penetrate to different depths
4. Creates reservoir of hydration in skin

**Why molecular weight matters:**
Your product contains multiple weights:
- **High MW (1,000-1,400 kDa):** Stays on surface, immediate plumping
- **Medium MW (100-300 kDa):** Penetrates epidermis, sustained hydration
- **Low MW (5-50 kDa):** Reaches dermis, deep hydration + collagen support

**Research evidence:**
- 2% HA significantly increases skin hydration after 2 weeks
- Multiple molecular weights more effective than single weight
- Works best on damp skin (has water to bind to)

**Application secret:**
Apply to **slightly damp skin** (not soaking, not bone dry):
- Too dry: HA pulls water from deeper skin layers (bad)
- Too wet: Dilutes concentration
- **Just right:** Lightly damp = optimal water binding

**Side effects (rare):**
- Can feel sticky if too much applied
- May cause breakouts in very humid climates (draws too much moisture)
- Not truly side effects, just technique issues

**Bryan's protocol:** Uses "as desired" - optional but beneficial hydration boost

---

### 4. CERAMIDES

**What they are:**
Lipids (fats) that make up 50% of skin barrier.

**Your products:** CeraVe Cleanser, PM Lotion, Moisturizing Cream

**Types in your products:**
- Ceramide 1 (EOS)
- Ceramide 3 (NP)
- Ceramide 6-II (AP)

**What they do:**

**✅ Barrier Repair:**
- Restore lipid layer that protects skin
- Fill gaps in damaged barrier
- Prevent moisture loss
- Protect against irritants

**✅ Hydration:**
- Lock moisture into skin
- Prevent transepidermal water loss (TEWL)
- Maintain optimal hydration levels

**✅ Protection:**
- Shield against environmental aggressors
- Block pollutants and allergens
- Reduce sensitivity

**✅ Anti-Aging:**
- Healthy barrier = better function
- Prevents premature aging from barrier damage
- Supports skin's natural repair processes

**How they work:**
Ceramides are like mortar between bricks (skin cells):
1. Fill spaces between corneocytes (skin cells)
2. Create protective seal
3. Prevent water escape
4. Block external irritants
5. Maintain acidic pH (healthy skin = pH 4.5-5.5)

**Why 3 types matter:**
Different ceramides play different roles:
- **Ceramide 1:** Long-chain, surface barrier
- **Ceramide 3:** Most abundant, general barrier function
- **Ceramide 6-II:** Short-chain, deep barrier repair

**Research evidence:**
- Topical ceramides significantly improve barrier function in 2-4 weeks
- Most effective when combined with cholesterol and fatty acids (CeraVe includes these)
- Proven to treat and prevent eczema, dermatitis
- Essential for aging skin (ceramide levels decrease with age)

**Side effects:**
- None known - ceramides are naturally occurring in skin
- Very well tolerated by all skin types
- Safe for sensitive skin, eczema, rosacea

**Bryan's protocol:** Emphasizes barrier health - ceramides are foundation of healthy skin

### 5. MINERAL SUNSCREEN (Zinc Oxide + Titanium Dioxide)

**What it is:**
Physical UV filters that sit on skin surface and reflect UV rays.

**Your filters:**
- Zinc Oxide 13.8%
- Titanium Dioxide 7.6%

**What it does:**

**✅ UV Protection:**
- Reflects UVA rays (aging, cancer-causing)
- Reflects UVB rays (burning)
- Immediate protection (no wait time)
- Doesn't break down in sunlight

**✅ Safety:**
- Sits on skin surface (doesn't absorb)
- Non-irritating
- Hypoallergenic
- Safe for sensitive skin
- Reef-safe (no ocean damage)

**✅ Anti-Aging:**
- Prevents photoaging (wrinkles, spots)
- Stops collagen breakdown from UV
- Maintains skin elasticity
- #1 anti-aging product (Bryan's emphasis)

**✅ Soothing:**
- Zinc oxide calms inflammation
- Helps heal irritated skin
- Good for acne-prone skin

**How it works:**
Mineral filters are physical barriers:
1. Sit on skin surface
2. Reflect UV rays like a mirror
3. Scatter UV in all directions
4. Don't penetrate skin
5. Don't react with skin chemistry

**Zinc Oxide vs Titanium Dioxide:**
- **Zinc Oxide:** Broad spectrum (UVA + UVB), better for aging protection
- **Titanium Dioxide:** Mostly UVB, some UVA, often combined with zinc
- **Together:** Complete broad spectrum protection

**Why mineral over chemical?**

| Feature | Mineral | Chemical |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Mechanism** | Reflects UV | Absorbs UV |
| **Onset** | Immediate | 20-30 min wait |
| **Skin penetration** | None | Absorbs into skin |
| **Irritation** | Rare | Common |
| **Endocrine disruption** | No | Some filters yes |
| **Photo-stability** | Stable | Some degrade in sun |
| **Reef safety** | Safe | Many banned |
| **White cast** | Yes | No |

**Research evidence:**
- Daily SPF 30+ reduces skin aging by 24% (study over 4.5 years)
- Mineral filters provide superior UVA protection (aging rays)
- Zinc oxide is only FDA-approved filter for broad UVA1 protection

**The white cast:**
- **Why it happens:** Zinc oxide is white powder
- **Is it bad?** No - proves it's working as physical barrier
- **How to minimize:** Blend thoroughly, wait 5 min, use tinted version
- **Benefit:** You can SEE the protection on your skin

**Side effects:**
- White cast (cosmetic, not harmful)
- Can feel heavy (rich texture)
- May rub off on clothes
- None are true side effects, just characteristics

**Bryan's protocol:** Uses MINERAL sunscreen specifically (chemical sunscreens are endocrine disruptors)

   - Better anti-aging effects

3. **Mechanism:** Light absorbed by cytochrome c oxidase in mitochondria
   - Increases cellular respiration
   - More ATP production
   - Better cell function
   - Enhanced repair and regeneration

**Research evidence:**
- 12 weeks of red light: 36% reduction in wrinkles, 19% increase in collagen
- Near-infrared: Significant improvement in skin density and elasticity
- Anti-inflammatory effects comparable to some topical medications
- 10-20 minutes, 3x per week is optimal frequency

**Safety:**
- FDA-cleared for safety
- No UV light (won't burn or tan)
- Non-invasive, non-thermal
- Safe for all skin types
- No downtime

**Side effects (if misused):**
- Overuse (>20 min) can cause hyperpigmentation
