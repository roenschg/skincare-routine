# Daily Skincare Routine - Quick Reference
## Bryan Johnson's Blueprint Protocol 2025

---

## 🌅 MORNING ROUTINE (5-7 min)

**Skin State:** Follow wet/dry instructions for each step

1. **Cleanse** - CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser
   - Apply to **dry or damp skin**
   - Massage 30 seconds
   - Rinse with water
   - **Pat dry** with towel

2. **Vitamin C** - The Ordinary 23%
   - Apply to **COMPLETELY DRY skin** (critical)
   - Water oxidizes Vitamin C
   - Wait 2-3 min to absorb
   - Pea-sized amount

3. **Niacinamide** - CeraVe PM Lotion
   - Apply to **dry skin**
   - Face + neck
   - Wait 1-2 min

4. **Sunscreen** - CeraVe Mineral SPF 30
   - Apply to **dry skin**
   - 2 fingers worth
   - Blend well

5. **Lip SPF** - Eucerin Lip Active SPF 20
   - Apply to **dry lips**
   - Thin layer

**⚠️ Until sunscreen arrives:** Use physical protection (hat/umbrella), avoid sun 10am-4pm

---

## 🌙 EVENING ROUTINE (10-12 min)

**Skin State:** Slightly damp skin (NOT soaking wet, NOT bone dry)

1. **Cleanse** - CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (removes SPF, pollution)
   - Rinse with water
   - **Pat dry** with towel (leave skin slightly damp)
   - **No wait needed** (you don't use Tretinoin)

2. **Hyaluronic Acid** - The Ordinary 2% + B5
   - Apply to **slightly damp skin** (critical for HA to work)
   - HA pulls water into skin - needs moisture to bind to
   - Wait 1-2 min to absorb

3. **Moisturize** - CeraVe Cream
   - Apply to **face + body**
   - Can apply to damp or dry skin
   - Generous layer to seal in hydration

4. **Lip Repair** - Eucerin Lip Repair
   - Thick layer before bed
   - Can apply to dry lips

## 🧴 WET VS DRY SKIN GUIDE

### **Why It Matters:**
Different products need different skin states to work properly:

| Product | Skin State | Why |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| **Cleanser** | Dry or damp | Works either way |
| **Vitamin C** | **DRY** only | Water oxidizes it, reducing potency |
| **Niacinamide** | Dry | Better absorption, no dilution |
| **Hyaluronic Acid** | **DAMP** | Needs water to bind to; pulls from skin if too dry |
| **Moisturizer** | Dry or damp | Seals in whatever is there |
| **Sunscreen** | Dry | Better adhesion, even coverage |

### **No 20-Minute Wait Needed:**
**You don't use Tretinoin**, so you don't need the 20-minute drying time.
- The wait is **only critical for Tretinoin** (causes irritation on wet skin)
- Without retinoids: Just pat dry and continue
- Slightly damp skin is actually BETTER for Hyaluronic Acid

### **Quick Check:**
After cleansing, pat with towel until:
- **Not dripping** (too wet)
- **Not tight/dry** (too dry)  
- **Slightly tacky** (just right for HA)

## 💡 PRO TIPS

1. **Consistency > Intensity** - Daily routine beats sporadic treatments
2. **Sleep 7-9hrs** - Bryan's priority #1
3. **Morning sunlight** - 10-15 min before 10am (no SPF)
4. **Avoid sun 10am-4pm** - Or use UV umbrella/hat
5. **Clean pillowcases** - Change every 2-3 days
