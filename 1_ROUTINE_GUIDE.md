## Based on Bryan Johnson's Blueprint Protocol 2025

## 🌅 MORNING ROUTINE (5-7 minutes)

### Step 1: Cleanse
**Product:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser
**How:** Wet face with lukewarm water, apply cleanser, massage gently for 30 seconds, rinse thoroughly
**Why:** Removes overnight products without stripping skin barrier
**Wait:** Pat dry, wait until face is completely dry

### Step 2: Vitamin C
**Product:** The Ordinary Vitamin C Suspension 23%
**How:** Pea-sized amount on dry face (avoid eye area), massage until absorbed
**Why:** Antioxidant protection, boosts collagen synthesis, brightens
**Wait:** 2-3 minutes to fully absorb
**Note:** Texture may feel gritty - this is normal for pure L-Ascorbic Acid

### Step 3: Niacinamide + Moisturizer
**Product:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion
**How:** Apply to face and neck, massage gently
**Why:** 4% Niacinamide (anti-aging, pore minimization) + ceramides + hyaluronic acid
**Wait:** 1-2 minutes

### Step 4: Mineral Sunscreen
**Product:** CeraVe Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30
**How:** Apply generously (2 fingers worth for entire face), spread evenly
**Why:** Zinc oxide mineral filter (physical UV block), SPF 30+ protection
**Note:** May leave slight white cast - this is the mineral protection working

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Reapply every 2 hours if outdoors between 10am-4pm

## 🌙 EVENING ROUTINE (8-10 minutes)

### Step 1: Cleanse
**Product:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser
**How:** Same as morning - removes sunscreen, dirt, pollution
**Why:** Clean canvas for evening treatments

### Step 2: Wait
**Duration:** 20 minutes
**Why:** Skin must be completely dry before next steps (reduces irritation)
**Do:** Relax, brush teeth, get ready for bed

### Step 3: Hyaluronic Acid
**Product:** The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5
**How:** Apply to slightly damp skin (pat face with wet hands first if completely dry)
**Why:** Deep hydration, plumping, reduces fine lines appearance
**Wait:** 1-2 minutes to absorb

### Step 4: Moisturize Body + Face
**Product:** CeraVe Moisturizing Cream
**How:** Generous layer on face, neck, and entire body
**Why:** Repairs skin barrier overnight, ceramides restore lipids, hyaluronic acid locks moisture
**How much:** Don't be stingy - apply liberally

## 💡 PRO TIPS FROM BRYAN'S PROTOCOL

1. **Consistency > Intensity** - Daily routine beats sporadic treatments
2. **Sleep is skincare** - Aim for 7-9 hours (Bryan prioritizes sleep)
3. **Morning sunlight** - Get 10-15 min before 10am (no sunscreen for this)
4. **Avoid sun 10am-4pm** - Or use UV umbrella/hat
5. **Hydration matters** - Drink plenty of water
6. **Clean pillowcases** - Change every 2-3 days
7. **Don't pick skin** - Let products do the work

**Remember:** Bryan's skin age improved from 64 to 37-42 over years, not weeks. Be patient and consistent!
