---

## Executive Summary

**Total Investment:** €367-417 (includes LED mask)
**Monthly Maintenance:** €30-40
**Savings vs Blueprint:** ~60-70%

## Core Philosophy

### What Bryan Johnson Does:
- Uses **evidence-based actives** (not marketing fluff)
- **No endocrine disruptors** (parabens, phthalates, chemical sunscreens)
- **Simple formulas** (5-10 key ingredients, not 40+)
- **Single-purpose products** (cleanser just cleanses, sunscreen just protects)
- **Consistent daily routine** over expensive treatments

### How These Products Match:
Each product below directly replaces Bryan's expensive items with the **same actives, same benefits, cleaner formulas** at a fraction of the cost.

---

## THE SHOPPING LIST

### 1. FACE WASH (AM & PM)

**Product:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser
**Price:** €10-12
**Where:** DM drogerie markt (dm.de)
**Size:** 236ml (lasts 3-4 months)

**Why This Product:**
- **Ceramides (1, 3, 6-II)** - Restore skin barrier lipids (Bryan emphasizes barrier health)
- **Hyaluronic Acid** - Hydrates while cleansing (matches Bryan's HA use)
- **Non-foaming** - Doesn't strip natural oils (gentle like Bryan's approach)
- **Fragrance-free** - No endocrine disruptors or irritants
- **Dermatologist-developed** - Clinically tested, proven safe

**How It Fits Bryan's Protocol:**
Bryan washes face morning and night. This cleanser removes dirt, oil, and SPF without damaging the skin barrier - **critical** for the actives that follow.

**Usage:** 
- AM: Quick cleanse to remove overnight products
- PM: Removes sunscreen, pollution, and prepares skin for evening routine

**Alternative if out of stock:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser (€12-15)

---

### 2. NIACINAMIDE (AM & PM - 4% Concentration)

**Product:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion
**Price:** €12-15
**Where:** DM drogerie markt (dm.de)
**Size:** 52ml (lasts 2-3 months)

**Why This Product:**
- **4% Niacinamide** - Proven anti-aging concentration (studies show 2-5% is effective)
- **Ceramides** - Skin barrier repair (Bryan's barrier-first approach)
- **Hyaluronic Acid** - Added hydration boost
- **Oil-free** - Won't clog pores
- **Non-comedogenic** - Won't cause breakouts
- **Fragrance-free** - Clean formula

**Why 4% Not 10%:**
- Research shows 2-5% niacinamide provides all anti-aging benefits
- 10% offers no additional benefit but increases irritation risk
- 4% is gentle enough for twice-daily use (AM & PM) as Bryan recommends
- Perfect for sensitive skin or those new to actives

**How It Fits Bryan's Protocol:**
Bryan uses niacinamide morning AND night. This product delivers his required 4% dose while also functioning as moisturizer. **Two-in-one efficiency** that matches his routine exactly.

**Key Benefits (Research-Backed):**
- Minimizes pore appearance
- Reduces inflammation and redness
- Regulates oil production
- Strengthens skin barrier
- Improves skin texture
- Reduces fine lines over time

**Usage:**
- AM: After Vitamin C, before sunscreen
- PM: After cleansing (before or after Hyaluronic Acid - flexible)

**Alternative if out of stock:** The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc (€7-8) - but dilute with moisturizer

---

### 3. VITAMIN C (AM Only)

**Product:** The Ordinary Vitamin C Suspension 23%
**Price:** €6-7
**Where:** Douglas (douglas.de) or The Ordinary website
**Size:** 30ml (lasts 2 months)

**Why This Product:**
- **23% L-Ascorbic Acid** - Purest, most potent form of Vitamin C
- **Direct-acting** - Not a derivative (derivatives are weaker)
- **No water** - Water-free formula means Vitamin C stays stable longer
- **No silicones** - Won't block other actives
- **Minimal ingredients** - Only 4 ingredients total

**How It Fits Bryan's Protocol:**
Bryan uses Vitamin C every morning. This is the **highest concentration** available without prescription, matching his intensive approach. The gritty texture is the trade-off for pure, potent L-Ascorbic Acid.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Antioxidant protection** - Neutralizes free radicals from UV/pollution
- **Collagen synthesis** - Boosts collagen production (Bryan's anti-aging goal)
- **Brightening** - Reduces dark spots and evens skin tone
- **UV damage repair** - Reverses sun damage over time

**Important Notes:**
- **Texture:** Feels gritty/sandy - this is normal for water-free Vitamin C
- **Application:** Apply to completely DRY face (water oxidizes Vitamin C)
- **Wait time:** 2-3 minutes before next product
- **Storage:** Keep in cool, dark place (fridge extends life to 3-4 months)
- **Tingling:** Mild tingling first 1-2 weeks is normal

**Usage:**
- AM only (never PM - Bryan uses it for daytime protection)
- Pea-sized amount for entire face
- Avoid eye area

**Alternative if too irritating:** The Ordinary Ascorbyl Glucoside 12% (€10-12) - gentler derivative

---

### 4. HYALURONIC ACID (As Desired - PM)

**Product:** The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5
**Price:** €7-8
**Where:** Douglas (douglas.de)
**Size:** 30ml (lasts 3 months)

**Why This Product:**
- **2% Hyaluronic Acid** - Optimal concentration (higher % doesn't mean better)
- **Multiple molecular weights** - HA chains of different sizes penetrate different skin layers
  - **Low MW:** Penetrates deep, plumps from within
  - **High MW:** Sits on surface, immediate hydration
  - **Mid MW:** Balances both
- **Vitamin B5 (Panthenol)** - Enhances hydration, supports barrier repair
- **Water-based** - Lightweight, layers well
- **4 ingredients only** - Ultra-clean formula

**How It Fits Bryan's Protocol:**
Bryan uses hyaluronic acid "as desired" - meaning it's optional but beneficial. This is his **hydration booster**, applied when skin needs extra moisture (especially in dry climates or winter).

**Key Benefits:**
- **Deep hydration** - Holds 1000x its weight in water
- **Plumping effect** - Reduces appearance of fine lines
- **Barrier support** - Helps skin retain moisture
- **Soothing** - Calms irritated skin
- **Compatible** - Works with all other actives

**Application Secret:**
Apply to **damp skin** (not soaking wet, not bone dry). HA pulls water into skin - if skin is dry, it pulls from deeper layers (bad). If too wet, it dilutes. **Lightly damp = perfect.**

**Usage:**
- PM: After cleansing, before moisturizer
- Optional AM: Before niacinamide if extra hydration needed
- Can skip if skin feels hydrated enough

**Alternative:** Eucerin Hyaluron-Filler Serum (Apotheke, €25-30) - more elegant texture

---

### 5. MOISTURIZER (Body + Face, AM & PM)

**Product:** CeraVe Moisturizing Cream
**Price:** €12-15
**Where:** DM drogerie markt (dm.de)
**Size:** 340g tub (lasts 4-6 months for face + body)

**Why This Product:**
- **Ceramides 1, 3, 6-II** - Three essential ceramides that make up 50% of skin barrier
- **Hyaluronic Acid** - Attracts and retains moisture
- **MVE Technology** - Time-released hydration (12+ hours)
- **Non-comedogenic** - Won't clog pores despite being rich
- **Fragrance-free** - No irritants
- **Dermatologist-developed** - #1 dermatologist-recommended moisturizer
- **Body + Face** - Bryan moisturizes both, this does both affordably

**How It Fits Bryan's Protocol:**
Bryan emphasizes **full-body skincare**, not just face. This tub lasts for face AND body, matching his holistic approach. The ceramide complex is identical to the cleanser, creating a **synergistic barrier repair system**.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Barrier repair** - Restores lipid layer damaged by sun/pollution
- **24-hour hydration** - MVE technology slowly releases moisture
- **Eczema-friendly** - Accepted by National Eczema Association
- **Versatile** - Face, body, hands, feet
- **Family-sized** - Economical for daily use

**Texture:**
Rich cream that absorbs quickly without greasy residue. Suitable for all skin types when used appropriately (thin layer for oily skin, generous for dry).

**Usage:**
- AM: Light layer after niacinamide (under sunscreen)
- PM: Generous layer after hyaluronic acid (seals in hydration)
- Body: Apply after shower while skin is still damp

**Pro Tip:** Bryan uses this on his entire body. At €12-15 for 340g, it's cheaper per use than drugstore body lotions.

**Alternative:** CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion (lighter version, same actives, €12-15)

---

### 6. MINERAL SUNSCREEN (AM Only)

**Product:** CeraVe Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30
**Price:** €15-18
**Where:** DM drogerie markt (dm.de)
**Size:** 75ml (lasts 2-3 months)

**Why This Product:**
- **100% Mineral filters** - 13.8% Zinc Oxide + 7.6% Titanium Dioxide
  - **NO chemical filters** (no avobenzone, octinoxate, oxybenzone)
  - **NO endocrine disruptors**
- **Ceramides** - Repairs barrier while protecting
- **Hyaluronic Acid** - Hydrates (unusual for mineral sunscreens)
- **Niacinamide** - Bonus anti-aging
- **Allure Best of Beauty Winner** - Industry recognized
- **Reef-safe** - No chemicals that harm marine life

**How It Fits Bryan's Protocol:**
This is **critical** - Bryan specifically uses MINERAL (physical) sunscreen, not chemical. Chemical sunscreens absorb UV (can cause heat/reactions). Mineral sunscreens **reflect** UV like a shield. Bryan avoids chemical filters due to endocrine disruption concerns.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Immediate protection** - Works as soon as applied (chemical takes 20-30 min)
- **Broad spectrum** - UVA + UVB protection
- **Non-irritating** - Mineral filters don't penetrate skin
- **Safe for sensitive skin** - Hypoallergenic
- **Photo-stable** - Doesn't break down in sunlight like chemical filters

**What to Expect:**
- **White cast** - Zinc oxide is white. This is normal and means it's working.
  - **Solution:** Blend thoroughly, wait 5 minutes, or use tinted version
  - **Benefit:** You can SEE the protection on your skin
- **Thicker texture** - Mineral sunscreens are heavier than chemical
  - **Solution:** Apply in thin layers, build up coverage
- **Longer-lasting** - Doesn't degrade as quickly as chemical sunscreens

**Usage:**
- AM: Last step of routine (always)
- Amount: 2 finger-lengths for face and neck
- Reapplication: Every 2 hours if outdoors; immediately after swimming/sweating

**Application Tip:**
Warm between fingers first, then press and blend. Don't rub aggressively (can create streaks).

**Alternative:** La Roche-Posay Anthelios Mineral One SPF 50+ (€18-22, DM/Douglas) - tinted options

---

### 7. RED LIGHT THERAPY MASK (3x per week)

**Product:** CurrentBody Skin LED Light Therapy Mask
**Price:** €300-350
**Where:** Douglas.de, Amazon.de, or CurrentBody website
**Wavelengths:** 660nm (Red) + 830nm (Near-Infrared)
**LEDs:** 132 LEDs (66 red + 66 NIR)
**Treatment Time:** 10 minutes
**FDA Cleared:** Yes

**Why This Product:**
- **Medical-grade LEDs** - Same technology used in dermatology clinics
- **Dual wavelength** - Red (surface) + NIR (deep tissue) for complete treatment
- **Proven technology** - FDA-cleared, clinically tested
- **Comfortable fit** - Flexible silicone, adjustable straps
- **Automatic shut-off** - 10-minute timer (prevents overuse)
- **Portable** - Rechargeable battery, travel-friendly
- **Warranty:** 2 years

**How It Fits Bryan's Protocol:**
Bryan uses red light therapy **3x per week** as part of his advanced routine. He states: "Red light therapy 3x per week" - this device delivers exactly that.

**Why Red Light Works:**
- **Stimulates mitochondria** - Increases cellular energy (ATP production)
- **Boosts collagen** - Fibroblasts produce more collagen when exposed to red light
- **Reduces inflammation** - Calms redness and irritation
- **Improves circulation** - Better blood flow = better nutrient delivery
- **Accelerates healing** - Speeds up skin repair processes

**Bryan's Results:**
While Bryan doesn't specifically attribute skin improvements to red light alone, it's part of his comprehensive anti-aging approach. Studies show red light can improve:
- Skin texture and tone (12 weeks)
- Fine lines and wrinkles (12 weeks)
- Collagen density (4-6 weeks)
- Skin elasticity (8 weeks)

**Usage Protocol:**
- **Frequency:** 3x per week (Mon/Wed/Fri or Tue/Thu/Sat)
- **Duration:** 10 minutes per session
- **Distance:** Direct contact with skin (mask format)
- **Eyes:** Keep closed or use included eye protection
- **Skin:** Clean and dry (no products during treatment)

**When to Use:**
- **Best:** Evening, before PM routine (cleanse → red light → HA → moisturizer)
- **Alternative:** Morning, before AM routine (cleanse → red light → Vitamin C → etc.)
- **Avoid:** Don't use immediately after harsh treatments or on irritated skin

**Safety Notes:**
- **Never >20 minutes** - Can cause hyperpigmentation
- **Not daily** - Skin needs recovery time between sessions
- **Eye protection** - LEDs are bright (mask includes protection)
- **No photosensitizing drugs** - Check medications

**Expected Results:**
- **Month 1-2:** Improved skin tone, reduced redness
- **Month 3-4:** Smoother texture, subtle firming
- **Month 6+:** Visible reduction in fine lines, improved elasticity

**Is It Worth €300-350?**
Compare to clinic treatments:
- **Professional red light facial:** €80-150 per session
- **This mask:** €300-350 one-time, unlimited uses
- **Break-even:** 3-4 clinic sessions = cost of mask
- **Value:** Use for years, share with partner, use on body

**Budget Alternative:**
- **Aphrona LED Mask** (Amazon, €150-200) - Fewer LEDs, still effective
- **Beurer FC 90** (Saturn/MediaMarkt, €80-120) - Basic but functional

**Bottom Line:**
This is Bryan's "pro tip" - not essential for basic routine, but accelerates results. If budget allows, it's the **single best investment** after core skincare products.
